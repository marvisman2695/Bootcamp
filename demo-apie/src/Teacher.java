public class Teacher {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      //OOP
      //5 Students, 23 Candy
      // 5.5.5.4.4

      //Student id = 3rd, candy count?

      //!Bonus (Teacher.java, Candy.Java, Student.Java)
      //Without using static candyCount, we use teacher object to hold 23 candy
      // candy Object with color, distributr to 5 students

      // Answer: Finally, teacher no candy. Each Student has his own Candy with different color.
